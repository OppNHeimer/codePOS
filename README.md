## A little more about codePOS

codePOS is the product of a short project to create a full-stack application using Ruby on Rails. It was inspired by the author's current love of the command line and past frustrations working in food service.

## Technologies Used

codePOS is a Ruby on Rails application which utilizes a postgreSQL database connected with Active Record. The application is deployed to Heroku.

## Next Steps

Originally, codePOS was envisioned to provide two modes of use. The first, a simple, touch-friendly graphic interface seen in the current version of the application. Second, the mode the app is named for; codePOS hopes to provide an even faster CLI designed for power users so that individuals in the service industry can make their work-flow more efficient.
