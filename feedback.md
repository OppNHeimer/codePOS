## Feedback

### Technical Requirements - 3
Includes many well-structured models, and advanced functionality such as authorization, 3rd-party API integration, or other technology not covered in class

#### Explanation 
Good job adding additional features we haven't talked about too much in class like the ApplicationController methods! I think using AJAX if you refactored this app in the future could make it really cool! 

### Creativity and Interface - 2
The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS.	

#### Explanation 
The interface looks really good! I really like the split screen view. You may want to try out SASS or a framework in the future! Also, if you wanted to refactor, making the app responsive so that it works on cell phones would be great!

### Code Quality - 2
Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues	

#### Explanation 
Overall your code looks great! I think the one thing throughout that could be improved is the naming of your models. Instead of Ingredients, Items, and Includes, you could do Recipes, Foods, and Ingredients, or MenuItems, Ingredients, and ItemIngredients etc. Includes is also a Ruby method that checks if an item is in an array, so the current naming is a bit confusing because of that. 

### Functionality - 3
App has advanced functionality that works with minimal errors, and may make use of advanced tools such as APIs, plugins, etc.

#### Explanation 

### Planning / Process / Submission	- 1
App is submitted, with basic evidence of planning. Documentation exists, but lacks common areas such as setup instructions, description of application functionality

#### Explanation 
I would add a descriptive readme with more information about your project. This is a format that I normally follow! https://medium.com/@meakaakka/a-beginners-guide-to-writing-a-kickass-readme-7ac01da88ab3
